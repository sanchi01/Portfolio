2) Web Analytics

  -Using PowerBI to create a dashboard that highlights the key findings and tells a story

3) Basket


Basket Analysis and Data Exploration
  - Investigated specific basket sizes.
  - Calculated total and distinct items in each basket.
  - Explored the distribution of basket sizes.

Specific Item Analysis
  - Analyzed herb marker occurrences ("HERB MARKER THYME" and "HERB MARKER ROSEMARY").
  - Identified baskets containing both herb markers.

Apriori Algorithm
  - Split transactions and transformed data into a transactional dataset.
  - Applied Apriori algorithm with specified parameters (support, confidence, minimum length).

If-Then Rules for Specific Items
  - Created rules for "HERB MARKER THYME" and "HERB MARKER ROSEMARY."
  - Inspected and analyzed the generated rules.

Handling Redundant Rules
  - Identified and handled redundant rules.
  - Filtered out redundant rules and inspected non-redundant ones.

Visualization
  - Created item frequency plot for the top 10 items.
  - Generated interactive visualizations of association rules (matrix plots, graphs).
  - Saved interactive graph as an HTML file.
